i could explain every natural phenomenon
the tide the grass the ground
oh that was me i was messing around
i killed a snake i buried its guts
sprouted a tree now you got coconuts
whats the lesson what is the take away
dont mess with maui when hes on a breakaway
and the tapestry here in my skin
is a map of the victories i win
look where ive been i make everything happen
look at that mean minimaui just tickety tappin
singin and scratchin flippin and snappin
people are clappin hearin me rappin
bring the chorus back in
